# OpenLeague
Open source game taht is inspired by League of Legends made using rust(probably) and SDL2 & OpenGL

### Will write in c++.
The plan:
Rewrite in c++
Create a client using Qt(maybe qt, unsure)
Make the client launch the game (but one could launch the game from the commandline with the server parameters). The client could also then start a server instance.
Then actually make the game lmao
